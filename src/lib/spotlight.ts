 *
 * Shared by every surface that hands another party a note, a report description, or a reroute
 * reason: the `get_case` WebMCP tool (`src/lib/webmcp/tools.ts`) and the plain REST surface
 * (`GET /api/case/:id`, the case SSE stream) both delimit with this exact function, so an agent
 * that talks to this origin over `fetch` instead of `document.modelContext` sees the identical
 * untrusted-content boundary a WebMCP tool call would have shown it.
